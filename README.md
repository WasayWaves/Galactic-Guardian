# Galactic-Guardian

A simple gaming project in C++ using the SFML library. This project is a simple 2D shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and tries to avoid obstacles while shooting down enemy ships.

This is just a starting point, and there's a lot I could add to make the game more interesting and challenging. Some ideas might include adding enemy ships, power-ups, different types of obstacles, and more complex AI.
